Anti-folk (sometimes antifolk or unfolk) is a music genre that takes 
the earnestness of politically charged 1960s folk music and subverts it. 
The defining characteristics of this anti-folk are difficult to identify, 
as they vary from one artist to the next. Nonetheless, the music tends 
to sound raw or experimental; it also generally mocks the seriousness 
and pretension of the established mainstream music scene.[source:WIKIPEDIA]
